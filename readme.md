# ðŸ›’JavaScript Shopping List

A dynamic shopping list application built with vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to add, update, and filter items directly on the DOM and saves your list with local storage for persistent data between sessions.

## Features

- **Add & Update Items:** Easily add new items and update existing ones on your shopping list.
- **Filter Through Items:** Filter items on the list in real-time.
- **Local Storage Integration:** Items persist on the local machine, so your list is saved even after closing the browser.
